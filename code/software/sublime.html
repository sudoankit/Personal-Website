<p> I find sublime text the perfect editor for most of the work. It's performant, it's built in C/C++ and with native, carefully crafted builds for every operating system, it beats every other (GUI) editor in terms of speed, performance for the features it offers. </p>

<p> Code editors are meant to be personal, to be used for a long, long time and Sublime respects this - it doesn't have an infinite number of features which are often uncessary. It focuses on the fundamentals and polishes them to perfection. </p>

<p> I don't want change, I just want a robust editor that I can depend for life and Sublime Text is perfect for me.</p>
