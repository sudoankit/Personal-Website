<h2>Food, Fitness & Health.</h2>
<span style="font-size: smaller;"> 
    
  <p><i>Much of my advice, observations on food is fine tuned for India only.</i></p>

    <h3>Personal Opinions</h3>
<h4>On Food.</h4>
      
         <ul>
          <li>The easiest and healthiest snacks/foods you can buy: dates, eggs, bananas, curd and milk. Inexpensive as well.</li>
          <li> Avoid bread. Market bread (packaged) of any brand is just bad in India. It's very unhealthy. We are not a bread society and it's shameful to eat bread + $X$, $X \in$ {jam, butter, nutella, $\dots$}, when we have so many tasty, healthy and nutritious Indian breakfast options such as idli, dosa, upma, apam, stew, parathas + a nice curry, etc.</li>
          <li> Avoid fast-food, (burgers, pizza, fried-anything) Self explanatory. You literally pay exorbitant prices for deep fried, frozen or sugary food. Craving badly? Make pakodas at home and match it with a legendary chutney.</li>
          <li> Avoid Indian street food, might be tasty but it's $100\%$ unhygienic. </li>
          <li> Sweets. I know India is famous for it but it's just bad. Control yourself. Discipline yourself to not indulge in this vice.</li>
  <li>Indian and Italian cuisines pretty much beat every other cuisine. You want vegetarian? You need Indian. There's really no cuisine that beats Indian vegetarian dishes. (Greek is pretty nice though). The explosion of flavour is impossible to achieve elsewhere, it's so great - even a simple jaljeera is pure bliss. Tell me which cuisine has such amazing flavours.</li>
  <li> I'm going to get bullied for this - South Indian Breakfast (esp. Tamil Nadu for idli, Karnataka for dosas and Kerala for puttu/noolapam/apam) >> North Indian. North Indian lunch/dinner >> South. Madurai has excellent non-vegatarian food. Tamil Nadu has the best South Indian food. Maharashtra/Delhi & UP have excellent North Indian food. </li>
  <li> Indian breakfast (tbh, the whole cuisine) has very less protein - supplement it well with eggs, chicken, fish etc or tofu, etc</li>
  <li>Rice + daal is an excellent and addicting combination, kichdi (+omelette) made simple is sublime.</li>
  <li> The daal India eats is mostly toor daal which is refined and while daal fry is very tasty I recommend eating/trying out other daals which are so much more healthier and nutritious. My favorites are harad daal (I believe this is very hard to get outside Odisha - it's basically toor daal with the fibre/cover/roughage), moong daal & masoor daal.</li>
  <li> Everyone should know how to make roti, rice, daal and a potato curry. </li>
  <li> Indian cuisine is much harder to cook than Western but it's the nice kind of complex, the difficulty rewards you with much more passionate, flavour-rich dishes. (We don't use preprocessed food!)</li>
  <li>Market ghee is substandard, you rather just use refined oil or just buy Amul butter and heat it to get ghee. True ghee is home-made, by fermenting milk for a long, long time and heating it once it reaches the boundary of turning rancid.</li>
  <li>Olive oil is bullshit for Indian cuisine. Doesn't work so don't waste your money. India has much richer and tastier oils. Mustard, coconut, ghee etc are so much better (you should know what oil for what dish though)</li>
  <li>Cast Iron is incredible to cook on. I have stopped using Teflon/Non-stick cookware. Cast-iron, steel, aluminium, clay! all great. Cooking using wood makes the taste different but it's not worth it - stick with electricity & lpg. Microwave is excellent. Safe and very, very useful.</li>
  
 <li>Before learning to cook, you should understand texture and what an ingredient does, we have forgotten the basics of taste.</li>
 <li>Grandmothers (& mothers) are super precious - she is your best teacher to learn cooking.</li>
    </ul>
     
 <h4>On Health</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Never self-diagnose. Don't search for symptoms on Google. Always go to your doctor.</li>
    <li>Workout. Pick a sports. Eat on time. Sleep on time. Eat healthy. Its simple. You just need discipline to be healthy.</li>
    <li>Don't procrastinate going to the doctor. The early the diagnoses, the better the prognosis.</li>
    <li>Doctors sometimes misdiagnose. If you feel you can't trust the doctor, switch or consult multiple good ones.</li>
    <li>Ayurveda as home remedies is fine, purchashing tablets, powder is unecessary and a scam. They dont do much. Stay away from Homeopathy. It's a scam. Only Modern Medicine is going to save you. It's pretty based, yeah.</li>
    <li>Trust science, not emotional BS.</li>
    <li>Your health is most important. Forget everything if you're sick.</li>
    <li>Sleep cycle is important, I have found waking up fresh after $1.5X$ hours of sleep with $X=5$ ideal for me.</li> 
    <li>Sleep, fitness, etc apps are shit, you really don't need an app for this. Make up your mind.</li>
    <li>Yoga is heavily commercialized now, just do simple streches and play a sport. Yoga? more like meh.</li>
    <li>Meditation has also become a huge profit making industry. This is a personal effort, you don't need to <i>learn</i> to meditate. Everyone innately knowns how to focus.</li>
</ul>
 

 <h4>On Social Media</h4>
      <ul>
        
        <li>Remember, once you write ANYTHING or post ANYTHING (private img, video etc) it stays on the web. Forever. You simply can't delete it. So BE VERY CAREFUL before uploading something personal.</li>
        <li>Social Media is usually overblown. Everything is wrong in this world or everything is utopian. Black and white. No shades of grey. You need shades of color in life. In real life.</li>
        <li>Social Media is built to be habit forming. How many of you do check it the moment you wake up? Instant messengers included. Endless feeds or endless messages in infinite groups.</li>
        <li>Fighting in social media is stupid. You'll always loose. Infact there's no winner. Don't be a social justice warrior. Just ignore and move on. I infact suggest to just lurk and hardly participate in online, anonymous discussion. The return is insignificant still.</li>
        <li>Discord, internet rooms, etc are terrible. Sometimes a few servers have good resources so just lurk and get what you need. No need to chat. You're going to waste time if you start chatting. Best is just avoid. You can get all resources on the internet.</li>
        <li>Always prefer real life friends, face to face discussions. The outcomes and positivity is much more than discussing on social media.</li>
        <li>Social media has reduced our attention spans. Kids focus just for 2-3 mins because of YouTube shorts, Twitter, TikTok and Instagram reels. Disgusting.</li> 
      </ul>
  
    <h4>On Entertainment</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>TV/Movies, etc are subtle snapshots of current happenings in the world. Yesterdays relevance isn't todays profit. So if a franchise you liked has changed much to your chagrin, live with it. It's business not passion.</li>
        <li>I have seen a lot defend or criticise a TV series or movies in a way that's it's the end of the world. Don't be emotional for just a franchise or fictional character. It's simply a show or a movie. Move on.</li>
        <li>Don't defend a corporation. No one cares.</li>
        <li>Critics reviews are far cry from general enjoyment for the mass. Always check it out yourself. Your opinions matter, not anyone else's because it's your time.</li>
        <li>Video games are an expensive, time consuming hobby that also can become addicted. Be careful. A few are worth investing time though.</li>
        <li>Don't consume. Select. Millions of hours of content are produced every year.</li>
        <li>Don't hate-read/watch. There's no need to waste your time on something you're not enjoying.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
   
    <h4>On Creativity</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Uniqueness is built on creativity.</li>
        <li>Develop your own views. Independent thinking. Sometimes "that's how it has always been done" isn't always bad!</li>
        <li>Surfing the web is endless. Mindless. Open your laptop/phone when you have work to do and just to that specifically. If you start randomly scrolling social media, reddit or similar you're simply wasting time even if it's something interesting. Learning something random when you have a specific work, deadlines and goals is simply stupid. Learning is good but not like this!</li>
        <li>Always prefer creating. Anything is fine. Writing. Making videos. Blogging. Life coaching. Cooking. Pottery. Woodwork. Anything that is <i>yours.</i> Proudly remember it. Producing something also gives a sense of completion, work done. Quantitive success. It's craft.</li>
        <li>Deep work. Always value depth in everything you create or learn. Don't be the jack of all trades but master of none.</li>
        <li>Mastery requires time. Practice. Perseverance. Dedication. Passion. You can't master everything you want in your life. Master something that's fulfilling for you, something you're passionate about and especially something that is going to help you in your career and get you money.</li>
        <li>There's really no point mastering something extremely niche which is only going to suck your time, money and health. Eg, mastering a video game is stupid (but might be fun) whereas writing or sports mastery is admirable, useful in life, healthier and professionally useful.</li>
        <li>I like my hobbies to also generate a side income.</li>
        <li>YouTube is saturated. It's not worth starting a channel for money. If you're passionate, sure go ahead. You'll loose time and money. Rather teach and sell your courses. Market. Learn outreach. Sponsorships.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
