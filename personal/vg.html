<h2> Video Games<span style="font-family: helvetica;">.</span></h2>
   
  <p>I tend to enjoy video games that have a large degree of freedom and allow experimental gameplay or the few unique indies that break the norms.</p>

  <p> Unfortunately as I grow older, I simply do not have time to play anymore.</p>

  <ul>  

    <li> Clash Royale, <span style="color:gray;">iOS, Supercell</span><br><span style="color:gray; font-size: 16px; ">This is the best mobile game till date. Infinite possibilities, infinite replayability. Polished to perfection. Fun banter with mates near and far, silly experimentations. Simply fun. Truly world class design. Moderately aggresive monetization but you're not a kid or an addict, right? Right?</span></li>


    <li>Battlefield 3, <span style="color:gray;">PC, DICE/EA</span><br><span style="color:gray; font-size: 16px; ">The last good battefield. May the last bullet, the roar of the F/A-18F, the might of the M1A2 Abrams and my tear for this franchise help it rest in piece. Press F, ladies and gentlement. Gently, please press F.</span></li>

    <li>Dark Souls, 2, 3, <span style="color:gray;">PC, From Software</span><br><span style="color:gray; font-size: 16px; "> Praise the Sun! Praise the Swamps! Praise Pontiff Sulyvahn! </span></li>
  
   <li>Assassin's Creed, 2, 3....Valhalla, <span style="color:gray;">PC, Ubisoft</span><br><span style="color:gray; font-size: 16px; ">...is a good franchise! The recent ones have gotten less assassin and more ass but still breathtaking large worlds of history that you can live, explore and just have fun! I really love the tours! Epitome of video game world building.</span></li>    

    <li>Far Cry 3, 4, 5 ...6, <span style="color:gray;">PC, Ubisoft</span><br><span style="color:gray; font-size: 16px; ">Might get a lot of flack for this but hey, hey people! the combat feels good, large maps to clear, multiple ways to approach a mission. Sometimes everyone needs a bit of mindless fun.</span></li>


    <li>Elder Scrolls IV & V: Oblivion and Skyrim, <span style="color:gray;">PC, Bethesda Softworks</span><br><span style="color:gray; font-size: 16px; ">You see that [x] button on your broswer? You can absolutely click on that. Joking. Elder Scrolls are just damn fine games and age just like a damn fine wine.</span></li>


    <li>Dishonored 1 & 2, <span style="color:gray;">PC, Arkane</span><br><span style="color:gray; font-size: 16px; ">Arkane makes some of the most fun, experimental games ever and this series is such a joy to play! Fast combat, clever routes to try, multiple ways to approach, interesting world and story all weave out an amazing game in perfect symphony.</span></li>
</li>


    <li>Into the Breach</a>, <span style="color:gray;">PC, MacOS, Subset Games</span><br><span style="color:gray; font-size: 16px; "> Even though this rouge-lite mecha-chess is quite RNG based, the information entropy and UI design is just sublime! It's pacific rim chess! What's not to like?</span></li>


    <li>Fallout 3, New Vegas & 4, <span style="color:gray;">PC, Bethesda Softworks</span><br><span style="color:gray; font-size: 16px; "> Always love me some fallout! Big, large post apocalyptic world filled with quests, loot, monsters, bugs and areas to explore! V.A.T.S and Nuka Cola automatically make this a must play. Avoid 76.</span></li>

        <span style="font-size: smaller;"> 
<p style="color:gray;"> I dislike turn based combat and RNG heavy games, ain't got time fot that! Heavy lore dumps and cutscenes every 10 mins are also a huge turnoff. Fetch quest, tired open world design are ok with me if the gameplay is fun and solid. I do not, absolutely do not play anything live service or MMORPGs.</p>
