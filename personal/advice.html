<h3>Advice I thought, read, heard, ....</h3>

<span style="font-size: smaller;"> 

<p><b>17 May, 2022</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of treating events as wins or losses, ask "Did I learn something I can apply in the future?" If not, you must treat it as a loss.</li>

<li>An insult given by someone you don't respect, should be immediately be taken as a compliment.</li>

<li>Consensus is just another way of saying average.</li>
<li>You get paid for being right first, and to be first, you can't wait for consensus.</li>
<li>A fit body, a calm mind, a house full of love. These things cannot be bought they must be earned. </li>
<li>Founders run every sprint as if they're about to lose, but grind out the long race knowing that victory is inevitable.</li>

<li>A taste of freedom can make you unemployable.</li>

<li>The skills you really want can't be taught, but they can be learned.</li>
<li>Building technology means you don't have to choose between practicing science, commerce, and art.</li>
<li>Twitter is a much better resumé than LinkedIn.</li>
<li>It is the mark of a charlatan to explain a simple concept in a complex way </li>
<li>Free education is abundant, all over the internet. It's the desire to learn that's scarce. </li>

<li>A busy mind accelerates the passage of subjective time.</li>
<li>All the value in life, including in relationships, comes from compound interest.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>29 April, 2022</b></p>
<ul>

<li>Write. It forces you to synthesize and create new thoughts.</li>
<li>Learn how to sleep. This is a priority.</li>

  <li>The ticket to victory often comes down to bringing your very best when you feel your worst. - David Goggins.</li>
<li>Don't be motivated. Be driven. - Goggins, again.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>24 Jan, 2022</b></p>

<ul>
<li>People laugh and compliment at poor jokes of rich, attractive or powerful people.</li>
<li>You're not smart enough, not hard working enough. There's always progress to be made.</li>
<li>Swing your sword again and again. Again and again. Keep swinging for the rest of your life.</li>
<li>Be accountable of your shortcomings, of yourself. Look yourself in a mirror everyday. You can't lie to yourself even if you try. <span class="hashtag">#accountabilitymirror</span> <span style="color:gray"> by David Goggins</span></li>
<li>Yearn for discomfort. Yearn to push yourself.</li>
<li>Non fiction is objectively better than fiction. Subjectively too.</li>
<li>Read as much you can.</li>
<li>NoSurf. The moment you open your laptop, phone etc you waste time. Waste so much time at unnecessary things, social media, surfing, news, etc. Why? Just why? Only use the internet/laptop/mobile etc when required eg, to call someone, to check important work/business/career emails, to work on problems, code, read what's required. Always for your current goal. Aimlessly surfing and acquiring knowledge is stupid. You need to learn it, work on it.</li>
<li>Be rude to yourself but not the others.</li>
<li>Have a <i>cold mind</i> and a <i>hot heart, </i><span style="color:gray">Nano Machine (Korean Manga)</span></li>

<li>Distractions have and always will be facts of life.</li>
<li>...the most sought-after jobs are those that require creative problem-solving, novel solutions, and the kind of human ingenuity that comes from focusing deeply on the task at hand, <span style="color:gray">Nir Eyal.</span></li></li>
