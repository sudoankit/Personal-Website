<h3>Advice I thought, read, heard, ....</h3>

<span style="font-size: smaller;"> 
<p><b>20 Feb, 2022</b></p>

<ul>
  <li>The ticket to victory often comes down to bringing your very best when you feel your worst. - David Goggins.</li>
<li>Don't be motivated. Be driven. - Goggins, again.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>24 Jan, 2022</b></p>

<ul>
<li>People laugh and compliment at poor jokes of rich, attractive or powerful people.</li>
<li>You're not smart enough, not hard working enough. There's always progress to be made.</li>
<li>Swing your sword again and again. Again and again. Keep swinging for the rest of your life.</li>
<li>Be accountable of your shortcomings, of yourself. Look yourself in a mirror everyday. You can't lie to yourself even if you try. <span class="hashtag">#accountabilitymirror</span> <span style="color:gray"> by David Goggins</span></li>
<li>Yearn for discomfort. Yearn to push yourself.</li>
<li>Non fiction is objectively better than fiction. Subjectively too.</li>
<li>Read as much you can.</li>
<li>NoSurf. The moment you open your laptop, phone etc you waste time. Waste so much time at unnecessary things, social media, surfing, news, etc. Why? Just why? Only use the internet/laptop/mobile etc when required eg, to call someone, to check important work/business/career emails, to work on problems, code, read what's required. Always for your current goal. Aimlessly surfing and acquiring knowledge is stupid. You need to learn it, work on it.</li>
<li>Be rude to yourself but not the others.</li>
<li>Have a <i>cold mind</i> and a <i>hot heart, </i><span style="color:gray">Nano Machine (Korean Manga)</span></li>
<li>Write down every single thing that is obstructing your path to your goals.</li>

</ul>

<p><b>1 Jan, 2022</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Time you plan to waste, is not wasted time.</li>
<li>Distractions have and always will be facts of life.</li>
<li>...the most sought-after jobs are those that require creative problem-solving, novel solutions, and the kind of human ingenuity that comes from focusing deeply on the task at hand, <span style="color:gray">Nir Eyal.</span></li></li>
