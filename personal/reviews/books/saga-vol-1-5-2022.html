<h1>Saga, V1-V5 <span class="sogrey">by Brian Vaughan</span></h1>
<hr>
<span style="font-size: smaller;"> 
<span class="sogrey"><p>Please note, Saga is a highly NSFW, adults only comic. I have tried to continue its ethos in my review - being beautifully explicit. </p></span></span>

<p>Saga is a handsomely humane story set in an incredibly weird wide world. </p>

<p>Every kiss, death, stab, blow, gunshot, thrust of a penis, slap, spark or even a strange medicine which needs the <em>semen of a dragon</em> have memorable stories behind them.</p>

<p>Saga's strength is from its parallel arcs with its memorable, vast and diverse, extra-terrestrial characters which follows their love, passion, pain, sadness and death. </p>

<p>The characters are in a never-ending wild, smutty, passionate orgy with the central themes of the story — sacrifice of parents for their children and loss of life due to war, whose deaths are intense climaxes felt after a long session of rambunctious edging, pain and lust.</p>

<p>Death is peace in a war, death is the final ejaculate — drench your memories of them with their final semen and maybe offer a prayer in silence.</p>

<p>Saga is a near perfect gourmet sci-fi fantasy story — war, soldiers, princes, monsters, ghosts, aliens, outcasts, rebels, parents, hunters, assassins, politicians and innocents all intertwined, served cold, bloodily, gruesomely and disgustingly with sprinkles of love — love for family, love for friends, love for your partner, love for someone unknown.</p>

<p>Gulp it all down with a bottle of alcohol and be awestruck in that hotness that burns your throat while you greedily want more of it and maybe shed a tear or two for the beautiful, memorable characters — friends you have lost.</p>

<p>Go on Brian, wow me more.</p>

<p><b>Review for Vol. 1 - 5 only.</b></p>

<p>Saga is an epic space story about a child born from two different species — Alana and Marko, two lovers from different worlds whose people are at war with one another. Unfortunately her parents become traitors and are pursued throughout the Universe. </p>

<p>The old, rich, powerful monarchy of one the planets are a family of robot headed humanoids who are very artificial yet have human emotions. The other planet is ruled by horned humans who can command powerful magic. </p>

<p>Assassins are contracted to kill the parents for breeding — brutal murderers you never want to be friends with but as the story moves you'll be surprised that <strong>you</strong> have <em>feelings</em> for them.</p>

<p>Vol. 1 - 5 follows Marko &amp; Alana's journey through multiple near death escapes, loss of life, exploring new worlds, searching for idols, making new friends, acting and theater, dooing drugs and lot's of fighting, struggle for money and of course, kidnappings and strangely getting involved in a vengeance story of a parent who has lost his child. </p>

<p>The fifth book didn't feel complete to me — I had bigger expectations for the long, central arc to end. It felt rushed yet limped towards the end. It didn't rush my blood to my hands to turn the pages faster, it didn't inject adrenaline and awe into my veins.

My favorite characters were just cut without any reason, without any salute. I didn't have time to mourn, remember them. I was angry that my good time with this fantastic series was disrespected.</p>

<p> As a human, I can only hope for the next and thereafter volumes to pay the price for my injustice and satisfy my aching, wildly throbbing heart to ejaculate praise for this epic <b>saga</b>.</p>

<span class="sogrey"><p>Ankit. <br>June, 2022.</p></span>

<span class="sogrey"><p>As Vol 6-onwards there is a time jump so I will cover Vol 6-10 after I read the 10th volume in the series (releasing October, 2022). I'm definitely very exicited for it!</p></span>
