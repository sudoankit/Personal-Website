<h1>Gideon Falls <span class="sogrey">by Jeff Lemire</span></h1>
<hr>
<p>The day you lose faith in God or science, you see true evil.</p>

<p>Such were the thrills, the mystery, the horror that I froze in the dead of the
midnight.</p>

<p>Andrea Sorrentino brings Jeff Lemire’s character &amp; world building to absolute heights. Gorgeously morbid, beautifully cold-blooded and enchantingly evil all wrapped in a mystery that spans the whole wide universe.</p>

<p>A priest time travelling the past and the future, an unspeakable horror that has escaped, murder and love, a trash collecting paranoiac, a barn in the country side, cowboys and sheriffs, sacrifice and blood all synch in perfect harmony to bring out this masterpiece.</p>

<p>Each page, each panel, each stroke of ink, color and text send frenzy emotions and disorienting nightmares to every fan who squeaks and shrieks in delight.</p>

<p>Red bleeds across pages to drown vast landscapes. The atmosphere is a wailing child born from a polygamy of ABC's Twin Peak, Netflix's Dark &amp; first the season of HBO's True Detective. </p>

<p>Unfortunately the plot weakens, the plot armour strengthens, error and holes creep into this exquisite artwork, nothing is explained, nothing matters. Vague.</p>

<p>Still, I was so drawn to the characters. I was frightened yet curious about the Evil. I was in awe of the world. I was riding the timeline.</p>

<p>Was I losing my sanity?</p>

<p>I'm afraid, I was still sane.</p>

<p>I got lost and scared more than before because it looked like the comic I used to love doesn’t love me back anymore.</p>

<p>Shameless. Abrupt, haphazard and silly. Gideon Falls vomits at the end and keeps vomiting even after it’s dead.</p>

<p>It kills itself in its own madness, it becomes more demented, catches a malady and spreads it in the later half. Suicide. The nightmare that was once believable, the one being that scared me is stupid and confusing. </p>

<p>Gideon falls used my go to horror comic, that deranged devil, that skull of a goat I used to pray and whisper, all that blood and wine that I poured, all those nightmares that I survived.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it evolved into a cliched, predictable and absolutely rushed, uninspiring drama garlanded with buzzwords of horror and sci-fi.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the journey was memorable and truly psychologically disturbing to the point that I was scared, my heart sweating profusely and was always looking at my window, my mirrors for that fucking smile.</p>

<p><em>That fucking smile.</em></p>
