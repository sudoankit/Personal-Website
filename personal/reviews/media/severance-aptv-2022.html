<p>I caught up with Severance, Apple’s new psychological drama last week while I lay on bed due to a terrible flu caused by an equally terrible weather spell that spread a blanket of dark cold gloom across the town. </p>

<p>I’m very picky about where to spend my time because in this decade, entertainment is like a coal mine. Netflix and chill? “No bueno”, please.</p>

<p>You got to find the diamonds in the rough. </p>

<p>Severance is one. </p>

<p>Mark (Adam Scott) a historian, has lost his wife due to a car crash and to cope and forget the pain, he <em>voluntarily</em> agrees for the <em>irreversible</em> “severance” procedure offered by Lumon Industries (a biotechnology megacorp), where your mind is bifurcated by a device inserted through a minor brain surgery. </p>

<p>Your personal memory can not be accessed once you’re inside Lumon’s deep secret underground office spaces and likewise outside the Lumon building you will not remember what you did at work.</p>

<p>I find it quite amusing that this probably might happen for Apple employees given how secret Apple is - very meta indeed. </p>

<p>The offices of Lumon are very Apple-esque, clean, minimal and compartmentalized like its products. The computers remind me of Apple's old Macs, the Helvetica font used everywhere feels very similar to Apple's default one, the polite, emotionless corporate talk is very reminiscent of the sugar coated corporate talk about caring for the employees.</p>

<p>I vividly remember a scene where Mark attends his sister’s pretentious dinner party without any food. The group, impeccably dressed, discusses current affairs and philosophy while a dim glow shines on their faces showing vivid emotions that you’re supposed to feast on. </p>

<p>A few personal snarky questions about the “severance procedure” pop up and Mark, visibly irritated, manages to calmly explain the group. The meeting ends with everyone “diggin’ in” food - a glass of water and of course, positive reinforcements.</p>

<p>“<em>Well, because your child is innocent of today’s atrocities, I’ll wait until after it’s born to murder you</em>” - Mark to his preganant sister, after the foodless dinner.</p>

<p>Severance is absolutely beautiful. The cinematography marries snow filled landscapes, old Volvos and neon lights. It’s the classic The Office but wrapped in Simon Stalenberg’s artwork, a slow burn dread, mystery and claustrophobic long winding office mazes.</p>

<p>Strong performances by the cast especially Adam Scott and Tramell Tillman raise the already absurd high bar set by crafted set pieces, cinematography, writing and visuals. There's so much love and emotions poured into this show about daily corporate life, absurd silicon valley tropes and a bleak sci-fi future shaped by mega corporate greed, politics and the corrupt.</p>

<p>Director Ben Stiller’s, dystopian workplace comedy, Severance is lined with streaks of Nietzsche’s naked thoughts that run rampant across Lumon’s, dull, cement gray, mechanical, corporate headquarters like little demon babies, while the employees praise and bask under the magnanimous, brilliant and visionary founder Keir and if you listen closely to every employees heart, you can hear Max Richter’s melancholy, “On the Nature of Daylight” playing in a continuous loop, only to stop when they drop dead.</p>

<p>Praise Keir! O, Praise Keir! </p>
