<hr>

<p>Disturbed by an anguished loud cry, millions of fireflies rose like the rising soprano in operas, swirling till they took the place of stars embedded in the night sky. </p>

<p>Amidst a weary, dark forest that wore haze, dew and dark as clothes stood a large ugly wooden hut, beautiful on its own. </p>

<p>The hut was made of strong pine wood, animal fur, leather and bones tainted with blood, straw, old large blocks of stones and a big chimney. </p>

<p>The fireplace had run out and had started breathing it’s last. A weak stream of smoke and despair rose from the chimney which was suddenly eaten alive by the fog and the dark. </p>

<p>Here lived an ugly giant, powerful, wise and rich. He didn’t have any friends thus he didn’t have any name. </p>

<p>Names have value when you’re loved and the giant never knew what that meant. </p>

<p>The land of Jacaranda, humans and monsters lived together but not in harmony. Monsters were outcasts, feared and hunted, discriminated and chastised, tortured and killed. </p>

<p>The monsters did the same. </p>

<p>The giant had killed many humans that threatened his life and had a strange habit of decorating his house with skulls of his victims. </p>

<p>He had put up a large fence around his home, each spike held a skull tight, a grisly memoir for him, horror for his enemies.</p>

<p>Jacaranda was a beautiful land, brimming with natural beauty, rivers pristine, cold and magical. Sweet fruits, rich meat and old alcohol. </p>

<p>A fairy tale bliss? Nah, my friends, far from it.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Jacaranda were cancer for this land. The smell of death, ominous thoughts and malaise gnawed every corner of her. </p>

<p>It was cold, always cold. It was dark, always dark. &#8718;</p>
