<h1><b>In Search For The Answer</b></h1><br><span>by <a href="/">sudoankit</a>, 2021</span>

<p>A sense of dread and despair sets in strongly once you reach a point in your life where you search for your purpose.</p>

<p>What problem do you want to solve? </p>

<p>Ironically the answer to this is not hard. The hardest part is choosing the problem you want to tackle. </p>

<p>An exciting problem that takes an entire life.
Every decade you inch closer to the solution. You split the problem into parts. You divide and conquer. Inch by inch. The satisfaction is impossible to pen down as you get closer. </p>

<p>You’re also defeated but you stand up. You keep standing up as if your life depends on it. You cry internally, your tears flow inside your mind. Flood it. You drown only to be woken again by a fresh, new idea, a new approach perhaps. </p>

<p>Such is the exhilaration, such is the joy. An entire life to polish the one single niche. </p>

<p><b>Jack of one trade, master of one.</b></p>

<p>This journey, unfortunately, is experienced by just a few. As I wrote at the top, choosing what to solve is the hardest. </p>

<p>A bad problem might leave you unsatisfied on your deathbed which is worse than death itself. A decent one is unremarkable but it might just get you going for your life. A good one is hard to find yet will fill you immensely. A great one is only reserved for the select and the best one will make you history. </p>

<p><i>Really?</i></p>

<p>All this writing sounds very cliche and honestly I want to slap myself for writing such a mediocre essay. I am visibly disgusted when I read it. This is the advice you get from random Quora answers, cheap self help books written by failures and Instagram quote stories by hormonal teens at midnight.</p>

<p>This has become a problem isn’t it? I request you to stop reading and think a few days on this. Don’t believe in my writings or advice. Don’t be blind.</p>

<p>The successful question everything and learn from everything. Mistakes, wins and tactics. Chess your life. </p>

<p>Chess your problems. Checkmate your miseries. </p>

<p>Checkmate your problem.</p>

<p>I think <b>everyone has not one but two problems to solve in a lifetime.</b> These two problems behave like parallel, intersecting and overlapping lines in your timeline. A dance and a tease.</p>

<p>The first problem is what I just wrote above, what problem do you want to solve?</p>

<p>The second one, I hope you guessed, is choosing what to solve?
I hope rather than setting resolutions this new year’s day, you’ll think about working on your two very important problems.</p>

<p>Happy New Year.</p>
