- You're not smart enough, not hard working enough. There's always progress to be made.
- Swing your sword again and again. Again and again. Keep swinging for the rest of your life.
- Be accountable of your shortcomings, of yourself. Look yourself in a mirror everyday. You can't lie to yourself even if you try. #accountabilitymirror - David Goggins
- Yearn for discomfort. Yearn to push yourself.
- Non fiction is objectively better than fiction. Subjectively too.
- Read as much you can. 
- NoSurf. The moment you open your laptop, phone etc you waste time. Waste so much time at unnecessary things, social media, surfing, news, etc. Why? Just why? Only use the internet/laptop/mobile etc when required eg, to call someone, to check important work/business/career emails, to work on problems, code, read what's required. Always for your current goal. Aimlessly surfing and acquiring knowledge is stupid. You need to learn it, work on it. 
- Be rude to yourself but not the others. 
- Have a Cold Mind and a Hot Heart.
- Write down every single thing that is obstructing your path to your goals.
- The ticket to victory often comes down to bringing your very best when you feel your worst. - David Goggins.
