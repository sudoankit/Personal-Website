# Ankit's Website

Personal website with links to my projects, blog, research notes and etc.

I made this website using Typora HTML export with some custom CSS I wrote. My philosophy is clean, minimal and a very fast website ( it's around <500KB, the Apple notes texture takes about 170 KB and my resume is around 120KB).

I will try to keep my website under 1MB as long I can.

## Blog

A research blog where I write long, quality and sometimes interactive posts. Tutorials, papers, etc. It's again made using Jekyll but without a lot of CSS removed for a clean design and quick load times.
