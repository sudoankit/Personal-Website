# Ankit's Website

Personal website with links to my projects, email, blog, social media and tcosl (?).

## TechStack

I designed this website using Tachyons ( a CSS library). 

Why? because I'm quite the stickler for clean UI, minimal design and beautiful typography. 

It's hosted at GitHub with a custom domain from GoDaddy.

I hope you like the website!

## Projects and Publications, 

`work.html`

This page uses [Jon Barron's](https://jonbarron.info) useful template for academic papers and projects. I have modified it a little bit for my needs.

## The List

`list.html`

My bucketlist: it's a direct HTML import from Typora + has small changes for rendering properly.

## Reviews [NEW, 2020]

`reviews.html`.

I created the background page using Autodesk SketchBook and styled it using Tachyon CSS. I hope to continue improving it while maintaining the artistic minimal look and feel.

Ankit, 2020.

P.S There are some other HTML files such as `interlinked.html`, `prologue.html` which are old drafts or notes I wrote. I am keeping those so that they inspire me to complete them/start fresh.
