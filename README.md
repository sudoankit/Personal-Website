# Ankit's Website

Personal website with links to my projects, blog, research notes and etc.

I made this website using Github's Primer CSS. I really love minimal design and beautiful typography. I use the fantastic **Inter** font for everything apart from a few pages that use Source Sans Pro (Google Fonts). 

The website is about < 80kb in size.

## Technical Details

Super simple stack.

- Barebones HTML for almost everything
- Hosting through Github Pages, free
- Domain, CDN, Analytics - Cloudflare, costs me approx $8.5/year

## Blog

A research blog where I write long, quality and sometimes interactive posts. Tutorials, papers, etc. It's again made using Jekyll but without a lot of CSS removed for a clean design and quick load times.

(Substack is great but not for technical writing. I think a "substack" for academics and esp. the science community might be cool but then again, we are overwhelmed with work, deadlines and assignments or maybe just too lazy to write. ;)) haha.
