# Ankit's Website

Personal website with links to my projects, blog, research notes and tcosl (?).

## TechStack

I designed this website using Tachyons ( a CSS library ). 

Why? because I'm quite the stickler for clean UI, minimal design and beautiful typography. 

It's hosted at GitHub with a custom domain from GoDaddy (I know, I plan to migrate soon).

I hope you like the website!

## Projects and Publications, 

`work.html`

This page uses [Jon Barron's](https://jonbarron.info) useful template for academic papers and projects. I have modified it a little bit for my needs.

## Blog

Atomic Thoughts. The blog is specifically made for shorter, quick posts and writings.

A simple, minimal blog using the [sidey](https://github.com/ronv/sidey). Thank you ronv for it! As it uses jekyll plugins I am using netlify to build and serve. 

## Explorations

A research blog where I write long, quality and sometimes interactive posts. Tutorials, papers, etc. It's again made using Jekyll but without a lot of CSS for a clean, quick design.

## tcosl [NEW, 2020]

`reviews.html` or the cofederacy of static love (name inspired from Toole's popular novel)

I created the background page using Autodesk SketchBook and styled it using Tachyon CSS. I hope to continue improving it while maintaining the artistic minimal look and feel.

Ankit, 2020.

P.S There are some other HTML files such as `interlinked.html`, `prologue.html` which are old drafts or notes I wrote. I am keeping those so that they inspire me to complete them/start fresh.

P. P. S To access more stuff you need to use absolute url, `thelist and vglist`
