# Ankit's Website

Personal website with links to my projects, blog, research notes and etc.

I made this website using Typora HTML export with some custom CSS I wrote. My philosophy is clean, minimal and a very fast website ( it's around 200KB, the Apple notes texture is taking about 170 KB).

I will try to keep my website under 1MB as long I can.

## Blog

Atomic Thoughts. The blog is specifically made for shorter, quick posts and writings.

A simple, minimal blog using the [sidey](https://github.com/ronv/sidey). Thank you ronv for it! As it uses some jekyll plugins not supported by gh-pages I am using netlify to build and serve. 

## Explorations

A research blog where I write long, quality and sometimes interactive posts. Tutorials, papers, etc. It's again made using Jekyll but without a lot of CSS removed for a clean design and quick load times.

Ankit, 2020.

P.S There are some other HTML files which are old drafts or notes I wrote. I am keeping those so that they inspire me to complete them/start fresh.

P. P. S To access these and more you need to use ████████████████. I'll leave the mysteries for you to find.
