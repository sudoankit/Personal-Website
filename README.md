# Ankit's Website

Personal website with links to my projects, blog, research notes and etc.

I made this website using Github's Primer CSS. I really love minimal design and beautiful typography. I use the fantastic **Inter** font for everything apart from a few pages that use Source Sans Pro. 

The website is about < 80kb in size.

## Blog

A research blog where I write long, quality and sometimes interactive posts. Tutorials, papers, etc. It's again made using Jekyll but without a lot of CSS removed for a clean design and quick load times.
