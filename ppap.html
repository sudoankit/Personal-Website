                <h3>Pens</h3>  
                <p>
                Uni-Ball UB157 (Fine),<span style="color:gray;">  0.7mm, Black, $0.7</span></br>
                <span style="color:gray; font-size: 18px; ">Essential. This is the perfect pen for me. Affordable, lasts long, writes very smooth, thick & water-proof. It's beautiful. It's like the perfect sword for the knight. My excalibur. Legacy. Optimus Prime.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                Uni-Ball Vision RT, <span style="color:gray;"> 0.5mm, Black, $2</span></br>
                <span style="color:gray; font-size: 18px; ">Another banger product by Uniball. Sharp, precise and really excellent ink. Zero spread. A bit expensive given the low quantity but refillable. Very difficult to purchase (in 2022) as it seems it's out of stock in many countries. This is hands down my favorite 0.5mm roller-pen.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                Uni-Ball UB150 (Micro),<span style="color:gray;">  0.5mm, Black, $0.7</span></br>
                <span style="color:gray; font-size: 18px; ">The 0.5mm version of UB157. The same great ink, same classic design. Writes a bit rougher than UB157. Nevertheless, good pen but I prefer UB157. Use this if you have <75 GSM paper.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                Pilot V7,<span style="color:gray;">  0.7mm, Black, $0.86</span></br>
                <span style="color:gray; font-size: 18px; ">The V7 writes far smoother than the V5. The downside of this is that it spreads more than the V5. I'm not very found of the long 'hi-techpoint' nib. It feels a bit wobbly and unstable to me. It's refillable, affordable, has great ink and is widely available. If UB 157 is the knight, this sire, is the confused squire.</span>
                </p>

                <p>Parker Vector Fountain (Standard)<span style="color:gray;"> $6-10<br> My favorite, affordable fountain pen that does the job. It looks great, has a great grip, great ink (quink), writes smooth and lot of body/material options. All rounder.</span></p>

                <p>Cello Techno-Tip, <span style="color:gray;">0.6mm, Blue/Black, Rs.10, India Only.<br>A great ball point pen. A durable plastic body workhorse. Very cheap. Writes decent and useful to fill OMR sheets (as these don't allow roller/ink/oil based pigments). Also look at Reynolds Brite, a cheap yet ridiculously smooth ball point pen.</span></p>

                <p>Reynolds Trimax, <span style="color:gray;"> 0.5mm, Blue/Black, Rs.60, India Only<br>My first "decent" pen. I remember being overjoyed when I purchased this. I was 11. It was ~Rs.30 ($0.37) back when it launched in 2006/7. I don't recommend it in 2022 as there are many cheap copies of it, leaks a lot and writes relatively rough. Still, isn't bad and Reynolds has a special place in every Indian heart.</span></p>


         <h3>Pencils & Co.</h3>
                <p>
                Staedtler Graphite 779</a> <span style="color:gray;"> 0.7mm, ~$5</span></br>
                <span style="color:gray;">All rounder. I really love this pencil. Well balanced, smooth and has a great rubber grip. Excellent to take notes and underline text in books. Just go for this. In blue, please.</span></p>

                <p>
                Sakura Foam Eraser XRFW-100, </a> <span style="color:gray;">~$1.5</span></br>
                <span style="color:gray;">Hands-down the most powerful eraser I have used. Rubs clean and perfect. Leaves almost no crumbs. Efficient and "tactical" erasing! A bit expensive but really, really worth it.</span></p>
  

                <p>
                Uniball Kurutoga</a> <span style="color:gray;"> 0.5mm, ~$1.5</span></br>
                <span style="color:gray;">The plastic "cheaper" version of the Kurutoga. Metal is 10x more expensive. These are alright. I sure do see the "rotation" mechanism work but it's hardly useful. Still, a great pencil nonetheless.</span></p>


                <p>
                Pentel GraphGear 1000</a> <span style="color:gray;"> 0.7mm, ~$14</span></br>
                <span style="color:gray;">The classic, iconic mechanical pencil. Very popular.
                Well built (apart from the middle connector), heavy and has an excellent, satisfying click mechanism to retract the lead. Not very good for long session due to the weight. Worth keeping in your collection though.</span></p>

                <p>
                Uniball NanoDia Blend | Pentel Ain Stein (0.7mm, 2B) | Staedtler Art 255 (0.7mm 2B)<span style="color:gray;"> </br>
                <span style="color:gray;">Use good quality leads. This is very important for pleasant, good quality writing. A good mechanical pencil needs a good lead, simple. Else you'll get a subpar experience. I like all my pencils be a bit thicker/smoother and a bit darker so I use 0.7mm, 2B leads. Feel free to experiment.</span></p>

                <p><a style="color: black;" href="https://www.solo.in/products/exam-board-buy-online-sb001">Solo SB001 Exam Board,</a><span style="color:gray;"> Rs.245, India Only<br>Really, a great exam board! If you're in India, you have to get this. Well built, lightweight, has a large clamp and looks great! Seriously, this is a fantastic product. Be sure to select "blue" and not "transparent blue"!</span></p>

<h3>Watches</h3>

  <p>G-SHOCK GW9200 "Riseman" <span style="color:gray;"> ~$150 (discontinued)</span></br>
                <span style="color:gray;">My first G-Shock and my first love of life. This is a friend. Always with me through exams, life and many, many ardous journeys. Extensive features, solar powered, comfortable, light-weight and really nice auto light. 9 years old, still works exceptionally well. "Dragon" backside.</span></p> 

<p>G-SHOCK G-9000-1VDR "Mudman"<span style="color:gray;"> ~$140</span></br>
                <span style="color:gray;">Essential. No frills, super tough, all rounder. Big buttons, very accesible, great strong light and handy. Long battery. What else do you need? This is a great your-"second"-gshock contender. Who doesn't want a watch with a terminator styled half-mole, half-tractor engraved at the back?</span></p>  

<p>G-SHOCK GW-9400-1DR "Rangeman"<span style="color:gray;"> ~$220</span></br>
                <span style="color:gray;">A fine, functional and well made G-Shock. Multiband, solar and three sensors all encased in that legendary shock resistant casing. A bit expensive and many don't need these features but hey, hey I love this watch! "Cool Wild Cat at the back!"</span></p>  

<p>Casio F-91W<span style="color:gray;"> ~$15</span></br>
                <span style="color:gray;">Essential. Small, lightweight, very cheap and the quintessential Casio. Ridiculously popular, from US Presidents to Pop Icons! Get yourself one today, just for you. The use ratio to cost is infinite.</span></p>  

<p>G-SHOCK DW-5600E<span style="color:gray;"> ~$70</span></br>
                <span style="color:gray;">If you're new to G-Shocks, this is the watch to go. It's essentially a G-<i>Shocked</i> F-91W. I consider this watch near essential (nitpick: buttons are too small). Affordable, trusty and very durable. Go anywhere, do anything.  I wear it daily.</span></p>


<p>G-SHOCK GX-56BB-1SDR "Kingman"<span style="color:gray;"> ~$140</span></br>
                <span style="color:gray;">Kingman is truly royale.  The final evolution of the F-91W. Such a story of valor, from peasant to king. Brutally tough, robust, large, meaty and loaded with essentials. Small nitpick is the that negative display but hey, you gotta spam that light! Ludicrous. Marvelous. Classic. Forever. Wear it and forget it, it'll show you the time even during a zombie outbreak, nulcear war or a 2012-scenario!</span></span></p>  

              
                 <p>Timex Ironman T5K202<span style="color:gray;"> ~$50  (discontinued)</span></br>
                <span style="color:gray;">I remember selling my gameboy to buy this bad boy. Great clean design. Loved the <i>ultra green neon</i> backlight. Wore it everyday at school. Sadly the construction isn't as robust like g-shocks. Screen used to get misty and the strap broke multiple times. If you love something, you also love flaws, isn't? Maybe I was a kid.</span></p>  


<h3>Misc. </h3>
                

                <p>Apple iPhone <span style="color:gray;"> (Base Numbered Models) </span></br>
                <span style="color:gray;">Essential. I have been using iPhones for 10 years and without any question, it's still the best mobile device you can buy. If you can't afford, get a basic feature phone like Nokia 105.</span></p> 

                <p>Casio TQ-140 Table Clock (with Alarm)<span style="color:gray;"> ~$7<br>
                 Essential. It's a well built, quartz table clock with a loud alarm. Simple, no nonsense battery operated mechanical device. Trusty, handy and just goes with me everywhere. Cool fact: has radium hands, ;)
                </span></p>

                <p>Casio FX-991ES<span style="color:gray;"> ~$15<br>My Favorite Calculator. Our journey through my school years was memorable. Special. Slayed physics problems with this. Ravaged chemistry numericals. Conquered mathematic exercises. My partner in academic quests. Always in my heart.</span></p>

                <p>
                Apple AirPods</a> <span style="color:gray;"> or Wired EarPods</span></br>
                <span style="color:gray;">Expensive, I used to be very skeptical but after using AirPods for a year now, they are seriously indispensable. Perfect for podcasts, songs and just about anything. Good audio, comfortable and decent battery life. Wired EarPods have better audio quality though. I like them both.</span></p>  



                <p>Apple MacBook Pro 13"</a> <span style="color:gray;">M2, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD</span></br>
                <span style="color:gray;">The best laptop you can buy if you're a student. It's such a fine product. Stellar performance, rock solid build quality, light weight and really, really, really good battery life. It's a shame that Apple charges exorbitant rates for SSD and RAM upgrades that I  recommend getting as you can't do it later. Touch bar is useless and irritating. A larger screen with the same internals would be bliss and perfect. </span></p> 


        <hr>
        <p> <span style="color:gray;">Indian Prices coverted to USD. Exchange rates as on Oct, 2022. </span></p>

        <p><span style="color:gray;"> I use 75/80 GSM A4 white paper to write, take notes or solve problems. Everything. If you sacrifice being a bit organized, it's far cheaper than notebooks. Classmate notebooks, A5's are great. Rhodia makes great notebooks too.</span></p>
