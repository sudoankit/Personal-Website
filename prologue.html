<h1>Prologue ( draft v0.1 )</h1>

<p>I kept pressing that freaking download button on my iPhone to download a particular epic instrumental music I wanted to listen. I had to travel for an hour and what's more orgasmic than the cool evening breeze hitting your face, the vibration of the bus slowly singing you a lullaby while your earphones tell you the story of a beautiful orgy by violin, guitar and soft piano notes. It makes you think.</p>

<p>It makes you think about your crazy dreams, about your relations, about your pain. It questions your life, your existence, the fuck you're doing with your life. The speed of the bus adds more melodrama to your thoughts not that, you already had much of the Indian drama already. </p>

<p>The song didn't download. I got into the bus sad by my subscription choices and network connections. The ride wasn't particularly orgasmic but more inspiring for me.</p>

<p>I thought to write this book. </p>

<p>This book is just like a bus ride but without that song getting downloaded, without any promises. </p>

<p>You still need to think though. It's going to be boring, sad, inspirational, cruel and many more adjectives I can possibly put here but it's going to be something. It's an adjective for everybody. </p>

<p>Adjective for everyday, I guess this fits well in my story of life. </p>

<p>Ready?
Fastened your seatbelts? Well, there aren't any. </p>
