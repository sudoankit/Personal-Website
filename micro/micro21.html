      Viva la vida! Metaverse<span class="f7 db gray lh-copy">
      30th October, 2021</span> </b> 

      <span class="f5 db lh-copy measure-wide">
      
<p>I'm pretty excited about Meta as there will be a lot of money thrown at AR/VR research.
A company the size of Facebook going full ham on the "metaverse" is going to spurn a lot of competition. </p>

<p>You have got a market who rather want more privacy focused social platforms without advertisements, analytics or data collection for a monthly fee.</p>

<p>Hot startups too will spring up who want to be a part of this metaverse as the market will simply not allow Meta to own the only metaverse in the world. </p>
<p>Competition is good as it gives rise to better products, prices which ultimately benefit the users. </p>

<p>A huge number of small startups or single founder bootstrapped businesses will rise to serve Meta’s “metaverse” — add-ons, analytics or business tools. </p>
<p>I’m very, very excited because of the research and technologies that will spring up that I’m ready to forgive the demon inside the metaverse — advertisements. </p>

<p> We all know it and we all don’t want it but it’s inevitable. Ads power more than half of the top trillion dollar companies and will continue to do so. </p>

<p>I want to take a positive outlook here and give Meta my full support as even if there are ads in the metaverse it’s still worth pursuing this dream. Education will change, entertainment will. The world will.</p>

<p> If you’re excited about it and don’t mind the negatives that the industry might give birth to, invest yourself in learning all about computer vision, graphics and machine learning, architecture, optics and brain computer interfaces and even newer areas! </p>

It’s just not Meta that’s into the metaverse — it’s everyone soon and yes, I’m ready to build, experience and live in one too.

<p><i><b>Viva la vida! Metaverse.</b></i></p>

      My dear humans, I'm going E.F.E<span class="f7 db gray lh-copy">
      10th October, 2021</span> </b> 


      <span class="f5 db lh-copy measure-wide">
      <p><b>Embracing Finite Entertainment - E.F.E</b></p>

      <p>I have <b>ditched most of my electronic devices</b> I use in my daily life and went back to mechanical, cheap yet sturdy and reliable appliances.  The recent FB, WhatsApp, etc outage had zero impact on my life. I didn't even know about it and only found out days later!</p>

      <p>The mobile phone was (obviously) the most difficult device to replace. I didn't really use my iPhone a lot, mostly for browsing the web, setting alarms, using the torch, listening to music, occasionally playing mobile games and for what a phone does, calls and texting. </p>

      <p><b>Web browsing</b> on a small device is honestly a poor experience. Posture, urge to lookup stuff and just mindlessly browsing is 21st century horror. I didn't have to change anything for this, I just browse the web on my laptop now.</p>

      <p>
      <b>Setting alarms</b>, this is important, this is discipline. My super easy and effective solution was to get a desk alarm clock. The <a href="https://www.casio-intl.com/in/en/wat/watch_detail/TQ-140-1B/">Casio TQ-140-1B</a>. Cheap yet loud, reliable and it just works! I don't know why but it feels so much better looking at a mechanical watch.  
      </p>

      <p>My house in pretty much inside a jungle with wild snakes, boars, mongooses, mosquitoes, wild dogs, wild cats, bats and hundred different insect species. A <b>torch/flashlight</b> is very much essential as centipedes, millipedes, etc are simply not fun in the dead of the night. The <a href="https://www.evereadyindia.com/flashlight/evergreen-brass-aluminium-torches.aspx">DL63 by Eveready</a> is fantastic! Huge, brass made, heavy with a bright flood fill light. Pretty much a hand weapon, lol. Only flaw is that it uses 3 D-type batteries.
      </p>

      <p>
      Finally, the big question. Calls and SMS. I bought a <b>Nokia 105 Single SIM</b>. Fantastic device. Runs for a week, has decent call quality. Simple and effective. I use the <a href="https://www.npci.org.in/what-we-do/99/product-overview">*99# USSD method</a> for payments (UPI).
      </p>

      <p>
      Pause for a minute and relax. Think about the excessive electronics you have in your daily life. Infinite entertainment, social media, news etc. I love the olden days. </p>

      

      <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type: square;">A print newspaper ends after a few pages, online news does not. </li>
        <li style="list-style-type: square;">A photo album ends after a few pages, instagram does not. </li>
        <li style="list-style-type: square;">Talking front to front with people is more raw and finite but interaction with people on Facebook, Instant Messengers, etc are not.</li>
        <li style="list-style-type: square;"> An alarm clock has one use, a torch does just what's needed. A camera is just for taking photos. I don't need a device which does all of this as well as browse the internet and more.
        <li style="list-style-type: square;"> Paper/Pen over iPads, e-ink displays etc. Paper ends, pens go dry. iPads/writings tablets have comparatively, infinite space. Souless.</li>
        <li style="list-style-type: square;"> A paperback book is physical and beautiful. After reading it you keep it in your bookshelf. You remember the memories when you touch it, flip it, years later. An ebook/Kindle reader isn't beautiful. Years later you can't touch or flip it for the feels. You might also loose all your books if your account gets banned. </li>

      </ul>

      <p>I fear the day where we all are forced to use electronics for anything as simple as going to the toilet! Printed material, simple gadgets, pen and paper, etc will slowly fade awat and might find homes in museums and antique stores.</p>

      <p>I hope we keep creating these devices with modern materials (easy on the planet) and changing times keeping the simplicity constant. An alarm clock in the 1900s, 2000s and 2100s should just ring when required.</p>

      <p>Electronics devices shouldn't cage you, lock you in. Life isn't worth living without freedom. </p>

      Be free, embrace finite entertainment, go retro, live your life like it was supposed to - <b>finite</b>.

      Fully Vaccinated!<span class="f7 db gray lh-copy">
      24th September, 2021</span> </b> 

      <span class="f5 db lh-copy measure-wide">
      <p>I finally got my second dose of the COVID19 vaccine! Fully vaccinated!</p>

      India is doing an <a href="https://dashboard.cowin.gov.in/">absolutely amazing job</a> (841M total!), it started slow but once it picked up I don't see it stopping till we vaccinate everyone and beat COVID. 

      <p>Normalcy is slowly setting in, everyone is going back to work, businesses are opening up, classrooms are alive again. Of course, it's not like the <i>pre-COVID</i> normal but hey, it's something.</p> 
      <p>I feel we (as humans) have learnt a lot and have grown incredibly stronger. The whole world is fighting against this pandemic and it's such a powerful sight to behold.</p>

      <p>COVID19 was horrible but I feel it made us wake up, as we move past this tragedy I see more funding for health department, immense respect for doctors and health professionals, people working day and night in logistic/delivery services, scientists, sanitation workers and so many more.</p>

      <p> Bowing my head to each and everyone to make me feel special and cared for in these depressing times.</p>

      Thank you.

      Future Perfect?<span class="f7 db gray lh-copy">
      17th August, 2021</span> </b> 
        <span class="f5 db lh-copy measure-wide"> 
          <p>Gravity by Alfonso Cuarón is one of my favourite movies. </p>

<p>It captures what science is all about. Trying to push frontiers and if we fail, we try again.</p>

<p>Again. Again and again. We are scared still we try. We question. Question everything.</p>

<p>We rewrite the proofs, we rerun the experiment, we fiddle, we cry, we laugh, we are work harder till we sweat, till we bleed, nights become days and days are spent dreaming for the answer. </p>

<p>The journey is bittersweet but worthwhile. Discovery is sweetest for we are curious. Science makes us question and to question everything is progress, is intelligence. </p>

<p>Gravity's Soundtrack by Steven Price is a masterpiece. It rightly won an Academy Award. </p>

<p>The main title song - Gravity, <a href="https://youtu.be/K3-YGVb6Tbw?t=160">especially at the 2.40 min mark</a>, makes my four chambered heart and brain cry uncontrollably at the same time. A rare feat that I thought wouldn't be possible. </p>

<p>This is the tune &quot;science&quot; would sing. Terrifying yet beautiful. </p>

<p>I'm mesmerized by it. </p>

        <center>$b = 0.4a, \ldots, 2a$ when $a = 3$ </center>
      <br>
      A Cassini oval is a set of points, such that for any point $P$ of the set, the product of the distances $ | PP_1 | $, $ | PP_2 | $ to two fixed points $P_1$ and $P_2$ is constant, say $b^2$, $b > 0$.
      <br><br>
      If the foci of this curve are at $(a, 0)$ and $(−a, 0)$, then the equation of the curve is: $$ ((x-a)^2 + y^2)((x+a)^2 + y^2) = b^4 $$
