      Fully Vaccinated!<span class="f7 db gray lh-copy">
      24th September, 2021</span> </b> 

      <span class="f5 db lh-copy measure-wide">
      <p>I finally got my second dose of the COVID19 vaccine! Fully vaccinated!</p>

      India is doing an <a href="https://dashboard.cowin.gov.in/">absolutely amazing job</a> (841M total!), it started slow but once it picked up I don't see it stopping till we vaccinate everyone and beat COVID. 

      <p>Normalcy is slowly setting in, everyone is going back to work, businesses are opening up, classrooms are alive again. Of course, it's not like the <i>pre-COVID</i> normal but hey, it's something.</p> 
      <p>I feel we (as humans) have learnt a lot and have grown incredibly stronger. The whole world is fighting against this pandemic and it's such a powerful sight to behold.</p>

      <p>COVID19 was horrible but I feel it made us wake up, as we move past this tragedy I see more funding for health department, immense respect for doctors and health professionals, people working day and night in logistic/delivery services, scientists, sanitation workers and so many more.</p>

      <p> Bowing my head to each and everyone to make me feel special and cared for in these depressing times.</p>

      Thank you.

      Future Perfect?<span class="f7 db gray lh-copy">

          <p>Gravity by Alfonso Cuarón is one of my favourite movies. </p>

<p>It captures what science is all about. Trying to push frontiers and if we fail, we try again.</p>

<p>Again. Again and again. We are scared still we try. We question. Question everything.</p>

<p>We rewrite the proofs, we rerun the experiment, we fiddle, we cry, we laugh, we are work harder till we sweat, till we bleed, nights become days and days are spent dreaming for the answer. </p>

<p>The journey is bittersweet but worthwhile. Discovery is sweetest for we are curious. Science makes us question and to question everything is progress, is intelligence. </p>

<p>Gravity's Soundtrack by Steven Price is a masterpiece. It rightly won an Academy Award. </p>

<p>The main title song - Gravity, <a href="https://youtu.be/K3-YGVb6Tbw?t=119">especially at the 2 min mark</a>, makes my four chambered heart and brain cry uncontrollably at the same time. A rare feat that I thought wouldn't be possible. </p>

<p>This is the tune &quot;science&quot; would sing. Terrifying yet beautiful. </p>

<p>I'm mesmerized by it. </p>

        A great line I read in a <a href="http://myslu.stlawu.edu/~svanderv/chapthree.pdf" class="link underline dim black">book (page 70)</a> some years back:
      <blockquote>Noticing patterns or unexpected connections is something of an art, as is the closely related skill of asking productive questions. </blockquote> <blockquote> Successful mathematicians combine diligent exploration of new ideas with well-developed intuition in order to formulate appealing new results.</blockquote>

        <center>$b = 0.4a, \ldots, 2a$ when $a = 3$ </center>
      <br>
      A Cassini oval is a set of points, such that for any point $P$ of the set, the product of the distances $ | PP_1 | $, $ | PP_2 | $ to two fixed points $P_1$ and $P_2$ is constant, say $b^2$, $b > 0$.
      <br><br>
      If the foci of this curve are at $(a, 0)$ and $(−a, 0)$, then the equation of the curve is: $$ ((x-a)^2 + y^2)((x+a)^2 + y^2) = b^4 $$
      <br>
      I think they look cool! <!-- I'm working on a side project using these (and <a href="https://magenta.tensorflow.org" class="link underline dim black"> Google's Magenta.js</a>), stay tuned! -->

      I recently saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Li1k5hGBE" class="link underline dim black">this amazing video</a> about this animal which uses his its hammer-claw to deliver punches of over 80 km/h (fastest recorded punch of any living animal).
      <br><br>
      The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1XNdcOl_vY" class="link underline dim black">mechanism described in this video</a> is more fascinating and I really want make some simulations on how saddles act as springs.

      The recent Rick and Morty episode was fantastic and full of high quality sarcasm, throwbacks, homages and clever puns, jokes on cloning, religion, sci-fi and philosophy. Excellent episode, 10/10.

      I had this weird thought where I'm in an alternate dimension where my tooth plaque (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_plaque" class="link underline dim black">dental plaque</a>) are infact equations ($x^2 + 2x + 1$, $x^2 - 9$, etc) and the toothpaste would be a mix of the roots ($-1, \pm3$, etc). Brush daily with this toothpaste to break/clean/solve them for perfect oral hygiene. Toothpaste as a mix of roots was a pun, please <i>smile</i>. <br><br> Here is <a href="/micro/images/rootzpaste.JPG" class="link underline dim black">my horribly drawn <i>art</i> for this.</a> A masterpiece, right?

      So I thought to make a Twitter clone/static microblog for personal use, pretty good huh? Currently it's very raw and much of the code is simple HTML/CSS (Tachyon's CSS). I plan to slowly automate and write a static generator for this. </span>
